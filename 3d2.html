        <p>The dining room scene project creates a dining room that should have at least 12 unique modeled elements in Blender, such as a table, chairs, wine bottles, wine glasses, candles, candlesticks, a picture, a vase, a teapot, teacups and a window in this project. Besides the 12 unique elements, it also includes lights, camera, and materials. The target markets of the project are furniture companies, decoration companies, animation companies, and people who are interested in model design. The blender is used in the project, which allows customers to view the 3D effect faster and a more realistic kitchen design.</p>
